    "Welcome to Terrace, a collection of high-level utilities for writing concise and maintainable PyTorch code. I've been using PyTorch in my own work for a while now, and I developed these tools to boost my productivity. I'm now ready to share them with the world -- I hope you find Terrace to be as helpful as I have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Terrace provides two major features: Modules and Batches. Terrace Modules allow you to more concisely define your PyTorch models entirely in the `forward` method. Batches allow you to place all your data in nice classes rather than swinging around a bunch of raw tensors like a barbarian.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're writing a vanilla PyTorch model, you need to populate both the `__init__` and `forward` methods of your model. `__init__` specifies all the submodules of your model, including all the input and output tensor shapes. `forward` specifies how to use all these submodules in order to run your computation. A simple neural network with a single hidden layer might look something like this:"

    "There are two annoyances with this approach. First, the overall structure of the network is repeated in both the `__init__` and `forward` methods. This may be fine for a toy example, but it gets pretty annoying with larger networks. Every time you make a change to the architecture, you need to constantly scroll between `__init__` and `forward`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you need to specify beforehand what the input shapes to the model will be. In this example, changing the input dimension from 128 to 256 would require changing code in two places. For models with many inputs with shapes, this can be a real pain.\n",
